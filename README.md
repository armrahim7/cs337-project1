# CS 337 Project 1: Award Ceremonies
Group Members:
1. Dwayne Morgan
2. Noelle Barron
3. Arman Rahim
# Instructions:
1. Run pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Run python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg
3. Run python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
4. Run gg_api.py
# Additional Notes:
Our gg_api uses the hardcoded OFFICIAL_AWARDS_1315, however we do have a get_awards function that returns pretty good results.  
The human-readable .txt file also outputs from gg_api.  
The .txt file contains all the required goals, as well as the additional goals of getting the sentiment towards the hosts, the best and worst dressed  
attendee, the most popular parties, and the sentiment towards those parties.
